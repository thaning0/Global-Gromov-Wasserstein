# Goble-Gromov-Wasserstein
Python implementation of !["Globally solving the Gromov-Wasserstein problem for point clouds in low dimensional Euclidean spaces"](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/188409d2ad91db4fb13644d024d99074-Abstract-Conference.html)

## Required Python Packages

This project depends on the following Python packages for data processing, visualization, and latent factor analysis:

- **NumPy**: Used for high-performance numerical computation and array operations.
- **Matplotlib**: Provides extensive plotting capabilities for creating various types of charts and visualizations.
- **POT (Python Optimal Transport)**: Used for solving optimal transport problems, particularly useful for probability distribution matching and distance computations.
